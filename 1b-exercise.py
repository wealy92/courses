# ## Exercise

# ### Your task: build a chatbot

# Build a simple multi-turn command-line chatbot script. The messages format lends itself to building chat-based applications.  To build a chat-bot with Claude, it's as simple as:

# 1. Keep a list to store the conversation history
# 2. Ask a user for a message using `input()` and add the user input to the messages list
# 3. Send the message history to Claude
# 4. Print out Claude's response to the user
# 5. Add Claude's assistant response to the history
# 6. Go back to step 2 and repeat! (use a loop and provide a way for users to quit!)
